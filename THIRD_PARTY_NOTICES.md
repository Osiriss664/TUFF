# Third-party software and model terms

TUFF repository source is licensed under the
[Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). That license applies to TUFF's own source
and documentation. It does not relicense model weights or third-party
packages.

The dependency review below is dated 2026-08-26. The model source inventory
was synchronized with TUFF's catalog on 2026-10-06, including checks of the
pinned E2B, 12B QAT and Flash Next model cards. This inventory refresh is not a
new dependency or legal review. Anyone distributing a compiled product must
preserve the license and NOTICE material required by its exact dependencies.

## Model weights

Model weights are not included in this repository. The installer downloads a
pinned revision of each checkpoint and repacks it locally. Every entry below is
the exact revision TUFF installs. The license column distinguishes metadata in
the pinned quantization card from upstream publisher terms when that metadata
is absent or inconsistent. Source license files remain authoritative.

| Model | Source repository | Pinned revision | License stated by the model card |

| Qwen3.6 35B-A3B | [`mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit`](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit) | `38740b847e4cb78f352aba30aa41c76e08e6eb46` | Apache-2.0 quantization of Alibaba's Qwen3.6 35B-A3B checkpoint |

| MiniMax M2.7 | [`mlx-community/MiniMax-M2.7-4bit`](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/MiniMax-M2.7-4bit) | `66d2e5cb7c5cda05251b4625c504af4b034df7ff` | Modified MIT terms linked by the model card |

Google publishes Gemma 4 under the
[Apache License 2.0](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/apache_2). The GPT-OSS
checkpoints are the official OpenAI releases and are installed in their native
MXFP4 form rather than requantized.

The pinned E2B quantization card's `gemma` tag differs from the Apache-2.0
license stated by Google's [E2B model card](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-E2B-it).
The pinned 12B QAT quantization card has no license field or separate license
file; Google's [12B QAT model card](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized)
states Apache-2.0. These observations record the metadata difference rather
than resolving or replacing the source terms.

Flash Next's pinned quantization card also has no license field or separate
license file. Its linked [upstream model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next)
states `qwen-community-1.0` and supplies the
[Qwen Community License](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next/blob/main/LICENSE).
Do not infer Apache-2.0 terms from other Qwen checkpoints or from missing
quantization-card metadata.

MiniMax M2.7 is governed by the upstream
[MiniMax model license](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M2.7/blob/main/LICENSE),
which the pinned model card labels `modified-mit`.

Downloaded weights remain a separate work governed by their source terms. Do
not redistribute weights as part of TUFF releases.

The six optional image companions are repacked from the corresponding pinned
sources above: Gemma 4 E2B, E4B, 12B QAT and 26B-A4B, Qwen3.6 and Qwen3.8
Flash Next. Consult the same source model cards and license files for those
weights; packaging them separately does not replace their upstream terms.
